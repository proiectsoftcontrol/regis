1. Code Example Description:
----------------------------
In this example, ADC is set up to convert AIN0 using CH0 and CH1 sample/hold in 10-bit sequencial mode 
at 1.1MHz throughput rate. ADC clock is configured at 13.3Mhz or Tad=75ns
ADC Conversion Time for 10-bit conversion is Tc=12*Tab =  900ns (1.1MHz).

void initAdc1(void);
ADC CH0 and CH1 S/H is set-up to covert AIN0 in 10-bit mode. ADC is configured to next sample data immediately after the conversion.
So, ADC keeps convertion data throgh CH0/CH1 S/H alternatively. Effective conversion rate is 1.1Mhz

void initDma0(void);
DMA channel 0 is confiured in ping-pong mode to move the converted data from ADC to DMA RAM on every sample/convert sequence. 
It generates interrupt after every 16 sample transfer. 

void __attribute__((__interrupt__)) _DMA0Interrupt(void);
DMA interrupt service routine, moves the data from DMA buffer to ADC signal buffer and collects 256 samples.


2. Folder Contents:
-------------------
This folder contains the following sub-folders:
a. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\gld
        This folder will have the device GLD file, it is used for building the project. 
	This file was provided with the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite.

b. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\h
        This folder contains C header files useful in building this
        project. Device register and bit definitions are provided in
        the *.h file that follows the device name. These files were provided
        with the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite.

c. C:\Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\lib
        This folder contains library archive files, which are a
        collection of precompiled object files. The file
        named "libpic30-coff.a" contains the C run-time start-up
        library. These file were provided with the
        MPLAB® C30 toolsuite.

d. hex
        This folder contains three file types - coff, hex and map.
        These are files generated by the MPLAB® C30 toolsuite on build
        operation performed within MPLAB® IDE. The *.map file contains
        details on memory allocation for various variables, constants
        and dsPIC instructions specified in the source and library
        code. The *.hex file contains a binary file that may be
        programmed into the dsPIC device. The *.coff file contains
        a binary file that is used by MPLAB® IDE for simulation.

e. h
        This folder contains include files for the code example.


f. src
        This folder contains all the C and Assembler source files (*.c,
        *.s) used in demonstrating the described example. This folder
        also contains a sub-folder named "obj" that stores compiled
        object files generated when the project is built.


3. Suggested Development Resources:
-----------------------------------
        a. Explorer16 board with dsPIC33FJ256GP710 controller

4. Reconfiguring the project for a different dsPIC33F device:
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Project/Workspace can be easily reconfigured for any dsPIC33F device.
Please use the following general guidelines:
        a. Change device selection within MPLAB® IDE to a dsPIC33F device of
        your choice by using the following menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Configure>>Select Device

        b. Provide the correct device linker script and header file for your
        device. Device linker scripts and header files are available in your
        MPLAB® C30 installation folder under:
        Device Linker Script-
                YourDrive:>Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\gld
        Device C Header file-
                YourDrive:>Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\h
        Device ASM Include file-
                YourDrive:>Program Files\Microchip\MPLAB C30\support\inc

        c. Provide the appropriate path to your MPLAB C30 support file locations
        using the menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Project>>Build Options>>Project

        d. Chose the development board applicable to your device. Some options
        are provided below:


        e. Re-build the MPLAB® project using the menu option:
        MPLAB IDE>>Project>>Build All

        f. Download the hex file into the device and run.
